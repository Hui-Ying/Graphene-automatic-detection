# Graphene-automatic-detection

The purpose of this project is to automatically identify and separate the layers of graphene flakes from the . 
This repository includes implementations of 
- U-Net  was implemented as  the  first  step  for  segmenting  the  background  andthe  graphene.
- BT  â€“  Net architecture to find the thresholds of the pixel values of single and bilayer graphene flakes.
- Support Vector Machine(SVM) method with a Gaussian kernel to separate the graphene flakes.
- In conclusion, a comaprison among BT-Net, SVM methods and image processing methods will be discussed.
