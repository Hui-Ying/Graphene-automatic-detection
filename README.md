# Graphene-automatic-detection

The purpose of this project is to automatically identify and separate the layers of graphene flakes from the optical microscopic images. 
This repository includes
- U-Net architecture implemented as the first step for segmenting the background and the graphene flakes.
- BTâ€“Net architecture to find the thresholds of the pixel values of single and bilayer graphene flakes.
- Support Vector Machine(SVM) method using a Gaussian kernel to separate the graphene flakes.
- A comaprison among BT-Net, SVM methods and image processing methods.
